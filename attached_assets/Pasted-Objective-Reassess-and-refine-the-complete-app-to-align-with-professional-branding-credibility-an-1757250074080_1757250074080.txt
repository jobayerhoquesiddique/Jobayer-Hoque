1. Branding & Visual Identity
	•	Add a professional logo in a clean, modern style.

⸻

2. Business Information & Positioning
	•	Add company details throughout the app:
	•	Revenue Range: $5K–$10K monthly (kept intentionally modest to signal trust and realistic traction).
	•	Journey Start: Founded in 2024.
	•	Clients: 10–15 active clients.
	•	Tagline/Authority Signal: Short phrase highlighting expertise and professionalism.

⸻

3. Portfolio Section
	•	Showcase 10–20 projects in card format.
	•	Each project card should include:
	•	Project name
	•	Thumbnail image (mockup or screenshot)
	•	Category (e.g., web design, automation, branding, SaaS MVP)
	•	Short description (1–2 sentences)
	•	Price range (small/medium projects: $500–$5,000)
	•	Delivery timeline (e.g., 2–4 weeks)

	•	Price ranges (transparent, not inflated)
	•	Add-ons/upsells

	•	Growth journey
	•	Professional tone without exaggeration

⸻

6. Metrics & Social Proof
	•	Add revenue, client count, and project delivery metrics in the dashboard or about section.
	•	Use case studies/testimonials placeholders where relevant.
	•	Keep numbers realistic and growth-oriented (signal scaling, not exaggeration).

⸻

7. Covers, Images, and Visual Elements
	•	Add relevant stock images, custom graphics, or mockups for:
	•	Hero sections
	•	Portfolio previews
	•	Service explanations
	•	Ensure all visuals align with the app’s brand identity.
